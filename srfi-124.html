  <h1>Abstract</h1>

  <p>
    This SRFI describes the API for a full-featured sort toolkit.
  </p>

  <h1>Rationale</h1>

  <h2>100 SRFIs later...</h2>
  <p>
    This SRFI is based on <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-32/srfi-32.txt">SRFI 32</a>
    by Olin Shivers, which was withdrawn twelve years ago.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two backward incompatible changes to the API.  The most
    important one is that the
    comparison predicate now precedes the data rather than following it.
    Most of the SRFI 32 commenters thought that this is the better order, despite
    the then-widespread precedent.
    The other change is that the algorithm-specific
    procedures have been removed from the SRFI, though not necessarily from
    the sample implementation.
    For documentation on them, see SRFI 32 or the source code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Editorially, the text has been reorganized, removing the massive redundancies.
    As in R5RS and R7RS, procedures that return nothing of interest, and in SRFI 32 returned zero or
    more unspecified values, are now specified to return one otherwise unspecified value.  The multiple
    packages, most with only a few procedures, into which SRFI 32 is divided have been consolidated.
    References to
    <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-95/srfi-95.html">SRFI 95</a> and
    <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-5.html#node_chap_4">R6RS</a> equivalents have been added.
  </p>


  <h2 id="Whatvs.how">What vs. how</h2>
  <p>
    In SRFI 32 there were two different interfaces: "what" (simple) and "how" (detailed).
  </p>
  <ul><li>Simple: you specified semantics: datatype (list or vector), mutability, and stability.
  </li></ul><ul><li>Detailed: you specified the datatype and the actual algorithm (quick, heap, insert, merge).
  </li></ul><p>
    However, the difficulty with exposing specific algorithms by name is that the
    local optima in the search space of algorithms changes over time.
    For example, the "qsort" in the musl C library is actually smooth sort, not
    quick sort; Python and Java have switched from quick sort to timsort;
    some implementations of the C++ STL use introsort rather than quick sort.
    Having procedure names that imply e.g. quick sort, that do not actually
    implement quick sort, is confusing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, only the "what" interface has been retained.  The sample implementation
    uses some of the original SRFI 32 algorithms, but this is not a requirement of this SRFI.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Consistencyacrossproceduresignatures">Consistency across procedure signatures</h2>
  <p>
    Procedures share common signatures wherever
    possible, to facilitate switching a given call from one procedure
    to another.
    
  </p>
  <h2 id="Orderingparameterbeforedataparameter">Ordering parameter before data parameter</h2>
  <p>
    These procedures uniformly observe the following parameter order:
    the ordering, equality, or comparison argument
    precedes the argument(s) denoting the data to be sorted.
    In SRFI 32, the data-first convention was used, because it was
    consistent with all the implementations examined in 2002, with
    the sole exception of Chez Scheme.
    However, <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-5.html#node_chap_4">R6RS</a> adopted
    the procedure-first convention, which is more consistent with other Scheme libraries that
    put the procedure first — the "operation currying" convention,
    as in <tt>for-each</tt> or <tt>map</tt> or <tt>find</tt>.
    This SRFI uses the R6RS convention throughout.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Stability">Stability</h2>
  <p>
    A "stable" sort is one that preserves the pre-existing order of equal
    elements. Suppose, for example, that we sort a list of numbers by 
    comparing their absolute values using <tt>abs&lt;</tt> (defined below).
    If we sort a list that contains both 3 and -3,
    then a stable sort is an algorithm that will not swap the order
    of these two elements, that is, the answer will look like <tt>... 3 -3 ...</tt>,
    not <tt>... -3 3 ...</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A "stable" merge is one that reliably favors one of its data sets
    when equal items appear in both data sets.
    All merge operations specified in this SRFI are stable,
    breaking ties between data sets in favor
    of the first data set — elements of the first list come before equal 
    elements in the second list.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, if we are merging two lists of numbers ordered by absolute value
    using the stable merge operation <tt>list-merge</tt> and <tt>abs&lt;</tt>
    compares numbers by their absolute values, then
  </p>
  <pre class="wiki">(list-merge abs&lt; '(0 -2 4 8 -10) '(-1 3 -4 7))
  </pre><p>
    reliably places the 4 of the first list before the equal-comparing -4
    of the second list: <tt>(0 -1 -2 4 -4 7 8 -10)</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's a definition of <tt>abs&lt;</tt>, introduced just for the examples
    as it is not part of this SRFI:
  </p>
  <pre class="wiki">(define (abs&lt; x y) (&lt; (abs x) (abs y))))
  </pre><h2 id="Allvectoroperationsacceptoptionalsubrangeparameters">All vector operations accept optional subrange parameters</h2>
  <p>
    The vector operations specified below all take optional <em>start</em> and <em>end</em>
    arguments indicating a selected subrange of a vector's elements.
    This compensates for the absence in most Schemes of shared subvectors.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Requiredvs.allowedside-effects">Required vs. allowed side-effects</h2>
  <p>
    The <tt>list-sort!</tt> and <tt>list-stable-sort!</tt> procedures are
    allowed, but not required,
    to alter their arguments' cons cells to construct the result list.
  </p>
  <p>
    The other procedures ending in <tt>!</tt>, on the other hand, explicitly
    commit to the use of side-effects on their input lists in order to guarantee
    their key algorithmic properties (e.g., linear-time operation, constant-space
    stack use).
  </p>
  <h2 id="Sortinglists">Sorting lists</h2>
  <p>
    Note that sorting lists involves chasing pointers through memory, which
    can be a loser on modern machine architectures because of poor cache and
    page locality. Pointer <em>writing</em>, which is what the <tt>set-cdr!</tt>s of a
    destructive list-sort algorithm do, is even worse, especially if your
    Scheme has a generational GC — the writes will thrash the write-barrier.
    Sorting vectors has inherently better locality.
  </p>
  <p>In particular, all complexity guarantees assume that the basic accessors
    and mutators of standard Scheme have O(1) space and time complexity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reference implementation's destructive list merge and merge sort implementations are
    opportunistic — they avoid redundant <tt>set-cdr!</tt>s, and try to take long
    already-ordered runs of list structure as-is when doing the merges.
  </p>


  <h1>Specification</h1>

  <h2 id="Procedurenamingandfunctionality">Procedure naming and functionality</h2>
  <p>
    Most of the procedures described below are variants of two basic
    operations: sorting and merging. These procedures are consistently named
    by composing a set of basic lexemes to indicate what they do.
  </p>
  <table class="wiki">
    <tr><td>Lexeme</td><td style="text-align: left">Meaning
    </td></tr><tr><td><tt>vector</tt></td><td>The procedure operates upon vectors.
    </td></tr><tr><td><tt>list</tt></td><td>The procedure operates upon lists.
    </td></tr><tr><td><tt>stable</tt></td><td>This lexeme indicates that the sort is a stable one.
    </td></tr><tr><td><tt>sort</tt></td><td>The procedure sorts its input data set by some ordering function.
    </td></tr><tr><td><tt>merge</tt></td><td>The procedure merges two ordered data sets into a single ordered result.
    </td></tr><tr><td><tt>!</tt></td><td>Procedures that end in <tt>!</tt> are allowed, and sometimes required, to reuse their input storage to construct their answer.

  <h2 id="Typesofparametersandreturnvalues">Types of parameters and return values</h2>
  <p>
    In the procedures specified below:
  </p>
  <ul><li>A <em>lis</em> parameter is a list.
  </li></ul><ul><li>A <em>v</em> parameter is a vector.
  </li></ul><ul><li>An <em>=</em> parameter is an equality predicate.  See <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-128/srfi-128.html">SRFI 128</a> for the requirements on equality predicates.
    Note that neither this SRFI nor its sample implementation depend on SRFI 128.
  </li></ul><ul><li>A <em>&lt;</em> parameter is an ordering predicate.  See <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-128/srfi-128.html">SRFI 128</a> for the requirements on ordering predicates.
  </li></ul><ul><li>A <em>start</em> parameter or <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> parameter pair are exact non-negative integers such that 0 &lt;= <em>start</em> &lt;= <em>end</em> &lt;= <tt>(vector-length </tt><em>v</em><tt>)</tt>, where <em>v</em> is the related vector parameter. If not specified, they default to 0 and the length of the vector, respectively. They are interpreted to select the range [<em>start</em>, <em>end</em>), that is, all elements from index <em>start</em> (inclusive) up to, but not including, index <em>end</em>.

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
An ephemeron is an object with two components called its <em>key</em> and its <em>datum</em>.  It differs from an ordinary pair as follows:  if the garbage collector (GC) can prove that there are no references to the key except from the ephemeron itself and possibly from the datum, then it is free to <em>break</em> the ephemeron, dropping its reference to both key and datum.  In other words, an ephemeron can be broken when nobody else cares about its key.  Ephemerons can be used to construct weak vectors or lists and (possibly in combination with finalizers) weak hash tables.
</p>

<p>Much of this specification is derived with thanks from the MIT Scheme Reference Manual.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

None at present.

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>Weak references are a mechanism for building data structures that point at objects without protecting them from garbage collection. An example of such a data structure might be an entry in a lookup table that should be removed if the rest of the program does not reference its key. Such an entry must still point at its key to carry out comparisons, but should not in itself prevent its key from being garbage collected.</p>

<p>A weak reference is a reference that points at an object without preventing it from being garbage collected. The term strong reference is used to distinguish normal references from weak ones. If there is no path of strong references to some object, the garbage collector will reclaim that object and mark any weak references to it to indicate that it has been reclaimed.</p>

<p>If there is a path of strong references from an object A to an object B, A is said to hold B strongly. If there is a path of references from an object A to an object B, but every such path traverses at least one weak reference, A is said to hold B weakly.</p>

<p>Ephemerons, unlike simple weak pairs, allow the correct handling of
data structures in which the value points to the key.  For example, a
record may have a single field holding the key; if it's desired to
use these records as values in a weak hash table using this internal
key, ephemerons are necessary or the table will not really be weak.
</p>

<p>
Ephemerons are considerably heavier-weight than simple weak pairs, because garbage-collecting ephemerons is more complicated than garbage-collecting weak pairs. In MIT Scheme, each ephemeron needs five words of storage rather than the two words needed by a weak pair. However, while the GC needs to spend more time on ephemerons than on other objects, the amount of time it spends on ephemerons can be made to scale linearly with the number of live ephemerons, which is how a copying GC's running time scales with the total number of live objects anyway.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>
<tt>(ephemeron? </tt><em>object</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>

<p>
Returns <tt>#t</tt> if <em>object</em> is an ephemeron; otherwise returns <tt>#f</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<tt>(make-ephemeron </tt><em>key datum</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>

<p>
Returns a newly allocated ephemeron, with components <em>key</em> and <em>datum</em>.  Note that if <em>key</em> and <em>datum</em> are the same in the sense of <tt>eq?</tt>, the ephemeron is effectively a weak reference to the object.
</p>

<p>
<tt>(ephemeron-broken? </tt><em>ephemeron</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>

<p>
Returns #t if <em>ephemeron</em> has been broken; otherwise returns #f.
</p>
<p>
This procedure must be used with care. If it returns <tt>#f</tt>, that guarantees only that prior evaluations of <tt>ephemeron-key</tt> or <tt>ephemeron-datum</tt> yielded the key or datum that was stored in <em>ephemeron</em>.  However, it makes no guarantees about subsequent calls to <tt>ephemeron-key</tt> or <tt>ephemeron-datum</tt>, because the GC may run and break the ephemeron immediately after <tt>ephemeron-broken?</tt> returns. Thus, the correct idiom to fetch an ephemeron's key and datum and use them if the ephemeron is not broken is:
</p>
<pre>
     (let ((key (ephemeron-key ephemeron))
           (datum (ephemeron-datum ephemeron)))
       (if (ephemeron-broken? ephemeron)
           ... broken case ...
           ... code using key and datum ...))
</pre>
<p>
<tt>(ephemeron-key </tt><em>ephemeron</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>

<p>
<tt>(ephemeron-datum </tt><em>ephemeron</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>

<p>
These return the key or datum component, respectively, of <em>ephemeron</em>. If <em>ephemeron</em> has been broken, these operations return <tt>#f</tt>, but they can also return <tt>#f</tt> if that is what was stored as the key or datum.
</p>

<p>
</p>


<p id="reference-barrier">
<tt>(reference-barrier </tt><em>key</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>

<p>
This procedure ensures that the garbage collector does not break an
ephemeron containing an unreferenced key before a certain point in
a program.
The program can invoke a <i>reference barrier</i> on the key by
calling this procedure, which guarantees that
even if the program does not use the key, it will be considered
strongly reachable until after <code>reference-barrier</code> returns.
</p>

<p>Because one cannot reliably operate on ephemerons in a portable
  way without calling the procedure <code>reference-barrier</code>,
  <code>reference-barrier</code> is mandatory.</p>

<p>The following is an example where <code>reference-barrier</code> is
  needed:</p>

<pre>
;; Return the datum component of the ephemeron if its key component is
KEY. Return #f otherwise.
(define (ephemeron-ref ephemeron key)
  (let ((k (ephemeron-key ephemeron))
        (d (ephemeron-datum ephemeron)))
    (and (not (ephemeron-broken? ephemeron))
         (eq? key k)
         (reference-barrier k)
         d)))</pre>

<p>In this procedure, the evaluation of <code>(eq? key k)</code>
  is side-effect-free, so it can be evaluated at any time
  after <code>k</code> has been retrieved, in particular before the
  call to <code>ephemeron-broken?</code>. Without the call to
  <code>reference-barrier</code>, <code>key</code> may, therefore, be
  no longer referenced when <code>ephemeron-broken?</code> is called.
  In that case, this predicate would return <code>#f</code>. In other words,
  without the call to <code>reference-barrier</code>, a Scheme
  implementation may implement the above procedure as
  <code>(define (ephemeron-ref ephemeron key) #f)</code>.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>
Ephemerons are currently available in <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-ref/Ephemerons.html">MIT
Scheme</a>, in <a
href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ephemerons.html">Racket</a>,
and in Chibi, though current versions of Chibi have a bug; the
Chibi GC will not break an ephemeron properly if its datum refers to its key.
The MIT version allows ephemeron keys and datums to be mutated using
<tt>set-ephemeron-key!</tt> and <tt>set-ephemeron-datum!</tt>,
but this SRFI does not require this capacity, as it is tricky to
implement on systems where the GC runs in a separate thread.
The effect of mutable ephemerons can be achieved using immutable
ephemerons that hold <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-111/srfi-111.html">
SRFI 111</a> mutable boxes, provided care is taken to always point to the
box and not to its contents.
</p>

<p>
The implementation in <code>ephemerons-trivial.scm</code> does not have any hooks to the GC, but it is still a correct implementation, because there are no guarantees that the GC will ever break any ephemerons, or run at all, or even exist.  (Thanks to Will Clinger for this insight.)  It is portable to any R7RS-small or R5RS + SRFI 9 system.
</p>

<p>
The implementation in <code>ephemerons-racket.scm</code> layers this SRFI's semantics on top of Racket's native ephemerons.  The idea here is that the native-level ephemeron value is a pair containing the key and the datum, so that the key can be reliably retrieved and a broken ephemeron can be distinguished from one whose key or value is <tt>#f</tt>.
Reference barriers are not supported.
</p>

<p>The files <code>ephemeron-hash.scm</code> and
<code>ephemeron-tree.scm</code> are by Taylor Campbell, and constitute
a demonstration written in pseudo-Scheme of how ephemerons can be
implemented in full.  He has offered to provide assistance in transforming
them into Pre-Scheme for Scheme48.</p>

<p>
Ephemerons with built-in finalizers
are also available in GHC's implementation of Haskell under the name of <a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.1.0/docs/System-Mem-Weak.html">weak
pointers</a>.
